# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-

Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.

NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time. There’s a good chance you’ve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.

## Tweets Classification
Twitter is a social networking and micro blogging service on which users post and interact with each other through messages known as “tweets”. This model focuses on classifying tweets into 12 random categories..It has 3,218 tweets from different users. Code to scrap the data is available in this repository.

The data set is called "data_elonmusk2.csv".

### KMeans Clustering.
Distance computation in k-Means weighs each dimension equally and hence care must be taken to ensure that unit of dimension shouldn’t distort relative near-ness of observations. Common method is to unit-standardize each dimension individually.

### Results

Final k-means clustering pipeline was able to cluster tweets with different classes.

## Sentiment Analysis
This model is the practice of using algorithms to classify various samples of related text into overall positive and negative categories. With NLTK, I employ these algorithm through powerful built-in machine learning operations to obtain insights from linguistic data...
